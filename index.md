## About

This is a face recognition project I started at the start of the COVID pandemic around Aug 2020.
I'm planning to convert it into a SaaS product to make the web/mobile app development fast and easy.
The end product will help developers to easily integrate authentication system in their web/mobile apps 
by simply integrating thip at the backend and they don't have to worry about tech stack and development hassles.
